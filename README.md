**Q: For jobs, How much should I know and is excel really a need?**

**A: “It really depends on the position. For the most part it's Data Analyst positions that call for knowledge of Excel, some Data Analyst positions don't use Python or R at all. Hypothetically a Data Analyst shouldn't need Excel because they can do everything that Excel can do using Python/R/SQL but in practice Excel is the application of choice for non-technical people to look at data so some basic knowledge of it is necessary for communication purposes.”**.

**Q: If I go through everything here, am I guranteed a job?**

**A: “Anybody can learn the technical skills of data analysis if they have the time and apply themselves, so companies try to pick and choose the people best for their organization. Companies are always changing and trying to do things better, and a big part of data analysis is reporting your findings to people that don’t understand the data analysis. So if you can be open minded, kind, open to change, and a self starter, your skillset can get you a job tomorrow.”**.

## Overview

This roadmap is a high level overview of skills you should strive for to become a valued data analyst. Due to the fact I do not work within the data analyst world, some of materials covering advanced techniques will be outsourced to peer-reviewed sources. I will attempt to make the programming section as rigorous as possible to ensure you are comfortable with ETL & various mutations of data to fit your usecase. I will also try and verify the validity of the content in here with experienced analysts.

I will also try to expose you to the cloud so you can showcase something original on your CV that will give you the edge over candidates.

I'm also going to push to start reguarly watching Data Analyst channels here are some:

[Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg)
[Ali](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaDh-eU-lds_d9kS976vBVw)
[Kyle (Data scientist by some of the content overlaps)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr6_XCxMLXWGguWZi_93n7w)

Use these channels to take "Active breaks" use a different part of your brain.

## Stage 1: Understanding What Data is

You should be aware of the core fundamentals of what data is. How to present data, what contributes to a great visualisation, You will unlock the critical thinking portion of your brain on this topic.


[Review the Google DA Course 1 & 2](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&utm_content=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&campaignid=12566515400&adgroupid=117869292685&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20analytics&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507290840627&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5auGBhDEARIsAFyNm9Go6W35DpZV9ykk45xg46fwyy0apeXHMHvcWN6TowX741u6sJwM3cEaAkL3EALw_wcB#courses)

Note: The faster you go through the google content, the less it costs. Make sure you take notes and really understand. I will not be able to verify your knowledge on this so you have the responsibility to go through this with a fine tooth comb. Any terms you do not understand, google it, research it, digest it and move on.


## Stage 2: Excel 101

Again, this is not my domain, I'm highlighting what is to be required for you at minimum to be competitive in London, you should strive to understand these topics as much as possible. You have to be able to explain this to a normal person.

I have attached a csv file named:
*annual-enterprise-survey-2019-financial-year-provisional-csv.csv* 

for practical use when attempting stages 2.1 through to 2.7

Some of the lectures/videos will overlap and that is fine, what matters is you understand every single detail. Sometimes having different perspectives can help cement concepts. Make sure you understand them. If you do not, google, research and digest.

Use this [book](https://www.programmer-books.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Excel-2019-Bible-1.pdf) as a reference for solidifying your knowledge. You do not need to go through it linearly, just visit the content page and flick through to the section you need.



### Stage 2.0.1: What is excel?

[Review the excel VLOOKUP lecture - important!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3BYVQ6xIE4&ab_channel=ExcelCampus-JonExcelCampus-Jon)
### Stage 2.7: VBA macros
It is not necessary for you to go through all of this in one sitting. Make sure you can answer these questions before you move on.. What are macros? What is VBA? What is object oriented programming? What is the use in VBA macros?

If you can answer these questions then move on - We will visit this later after the programming module

[VBA macros - very important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G05TrN7nt6k&ab_channel=LearnitTrainingLearnitTraining)

### Stage 2.8: Hands-on look
- Visit [this website](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/?ftv=1)
- Select Annual budget
  
Go through the various other sheets in the annual budget and play around, find out how it works, change values, This is going to add an engineer's mindset to your repertoire.

When done:

- Go back and Select Monthly budget

Again.. Understand how things work, change the values, play around with it, delete things, look at the formulas/functions.. but make sure you understand what is going on.

You can choose to build a visualisation if you'd like to cement your knowledge, or you can move on.

## Stage 3: Databases & SQL

This stage is going to be extremely important because this is a Data analyst's bread and butter, you should know how to leverage database technologies. You will often feel you are repeating content, this is done on purpose so you can digest the content naturally.

[Review the SQL lecture - extremely important!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) Unfortunately you will need to go through this content in it's entirety.


[Review the Google DA Course 3, 4 & 5](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&utm_content=15-GoogleDataAnalytics-ROW&campaignid=12566515400&adgroupid=117869292685&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20analytics&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=507290840627&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5auGBhDEARIsAFyNm9Go6W35DpZV9ykk45xg46fwyy0apeXHMHvcWN6TowX741u6sJwM3cEaAkL3EALw_wcB#courses)

- SELECT
- JOIN
- DELETE
- DROP
- CREATE
- CONSTRAINTS
- etc
